A system for the interoperable representation and
visualization of activity data, such as step count, calories, sleep information, etc., from activity
monitoring devices (fitness trackers, smartwatches, etc.) using Semantic Web technologies. \n

The dataset used in this thesis comes from a study among 30 users of various FitBit devices who
consented to the submission of their personal monitoring data. From this dataset were used data
referring to heart rate measurements, step and calorie counts, sleep information, weight and BMI
recordings. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit  \n

The created system is able to convert activity data into triples compatible with the ontology designed for
it, to verify the validity of the data, to import them into a Semantic Database, and also to search among
them. Additionally, a web application was developed for data retrieval and visualization of the retrieved
information, aiming to simplify the userâ€™s interaction with the system and improve the understanding of
the results. \n
